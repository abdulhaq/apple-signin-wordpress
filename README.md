# Apple Signin WordPress Plugin

When I wanted to integrate Apple Signin on my WordPress website, I was surpised that no such free plugin was available on internet (at least I was not able to find after search for good 3-4 hours). Hence I had to develop something of my own and now decided to release it as a proper plugin which anyone can install on their WordPress website in just a few minutes.

## Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to **variable.php** file.

`client_id`

This is something like `com.example.com`

`post_login_url`

Where users should be redirected after successfully logging in

`kid`

This is Key ID and can be found on apple developer dashboard under Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles

`iss`

Also call Team ID, this can be found on apple developer dashboard under Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles as Identifiers

`private_key`

Your private key

## Installation

Once you have installed the plugin and changed the variables in **variables.php** file, you then need to add redirect url in you apple developer dashboard. URL should be like following:

```
https://www.yourwebsite.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=apple_signin
```
